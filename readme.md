# Exploring SOUTHWEST Flights
## by Mzoon Alwalmani


## Flights Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about the US flights in 2008 it has 6,737,141 flights with 29 features. after that the data has been cleaned and since I interested in SOUTHWEST just a subset from the dataset was used. now it contains 1,199,269 flights with 21 features.


## Summary of Findings

I explore things like what type of delay takes more time and found that it is the weather delay. Also,the relationship between the variables like DepDelay and ArrDelay and it is a linear relationship, and that in some how the distance has an effect on the Arrival dalay


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the departure and arraival times, delays,the distance, Actual and CRS Elapsed
